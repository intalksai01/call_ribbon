## 🔒 **What Clients Will See**

### **Before (Exotel visible):**
```html
<div id="exotel-call-ribbon-container">
  <!-- Exotel Call Ribbon -->
</div>
```

### **After (IntalksAI branding):**
```html
<div id="intalksai-call-ribbon-container">
  <!-- IntalksAI Call Ribbon -->
</div>
```

### **Client Integration Code:**
```html
<!-- Your clients will use: -->
<script src="https://your-cdn.com/static/js/main.js"></script>
<script>
  // They see "IntalksAI" branding, not "Exotel"
  ExotelCallRibbon.init({
    apiKey: 'their-api-key',
    position: 'bottom'
  });
</script>
```

## 🎨 **What's Still Internal (Not Visible to Clients)**

These keep Exotel references for your internal use only:

### **✅ Internal Code (Hidden from Clients):**
- Exotel SDK imports (`exotel-ip-calling-crm-websdk`)
- Exotel API calls (MakeCall, AcceptCall, etc.)
- Exotel credentials in server.js
- Internal variable names
- Backend logging

### **Why This Works:**
- Clients only see the compiled JavaScript bundle
- They never see your source code
- Exotel SDK is bundled and minified
- Your backend keeps Exotel credentials private

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **1. Rebuild Widget (Required)**
```bash
cd widget
npm run build
```

This will compile the new branding into your widget.

### **2. Deploy to AWS**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy-to-aws.sh

# Deploy with new branding
./deploy-to-aws.sh
```

### **3. Update Client Documentation**
Your clients will now integrate with:
- **Brand**: IntalksAI Call Ribbon
- **Container ID**: `intalksai-call-ribbon-container`
- **No mention of Exotel** in client-facing materials

## 🔐 **Security Note**

**Exotel credentials remain secure:**
- Stored only in backend (api/server.js)
- Never exposed to client browsers
- Transmitted securely via your API
- Clients never see Exotel tokens

---

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

After rebuilding and deploying:

- [ ] Widget shows "IntalksAI" in console logs
- [ ] Container ID is `intalksai-call-ribbon-container`
- [ ] AWS resources use `intalksai-call-ribbon` prefix
- [ ] No "Exotel" visible in client browser
- [ ] Calls still work properly (Exotel SDK intact)
- [ ] Client documentation updated

---

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

Your Call Control Ribbon is now properly branded as **IntalksAI** while still using Exotel's powerful telephony infrastructure behind the scenes.

**To clients, it's your proprietary solution. To you, it's powered by Exotel.** 

Perfect! 🚀
