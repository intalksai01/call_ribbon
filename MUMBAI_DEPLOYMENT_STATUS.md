## Resources Created So Far:

| Resource Type | Name/ID | Region | Status |
|--------------|---------|--------|--------|
| S3 Bucket | intalksai-call-ribbon-widget-mumbai-1759694831 | ap-south-1 | ✅ Active |
| CloudFront Distribution | E19YDUHE03AZ14 | Global | ⏳ Deploying |
| CloudFront Domain | d2exvahh38vvhs.cloudfront.net | Global | ⏳ Deploying |

## Options to Continue:

### Option 1: Wait for CloudFront and Continue (Recommended)
The script can be re-run and it will:
- Skip the already created S3 bucket (will fail but continue)
- Skip the CloudFront creation (will fail but continue)
- Continue with Elastic Beanstalk deployment

### Option 2: Manual Completion
You can manually complete the remaining steps:
1. Wait for CloudFront to finish deploying (check status with: `aws cloudfront get-distribution --id E19YDUHE03AZ14`)
2. Deploy API to Elastic Beanstalk manually
3. Update widget configuration with new API URL

### Option 3: Clean Up and Start Fresh
Run the cleanup script for Mumbai region and start over:
```bash
# Create a cleanup script for Mumbai resources
aws s3 rb s3://intalksai-call-ribbon-widget-mumbai-1759694831 --force
aws cloudfront delete-distribution --id E19YDUHE03AZ14 --if-match <etag>
```

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Check CloudFront Status:**
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront get-distribution --id E19YDUHE03AZ14 --region ap-south-1
   ```

2. **Once CloudFront is Deployed, Continue with API:**
   - Navigate to the `api` directory
   - Initialize and deploy Elastic Beanstalk manually
   - Update widget configuration

3. **Or Clean Up Mumbai Resources:**
   If you want to start fresh, clean up the created resources first

## Estimated Time Remaining:
- CloudFront deployment: 5-15 minutes (depending on how long ago it was started)
- Elastic Beanstalk setup: 5-10 minutes
- Total remaining: 10-25 minutes

## US East Region Cleanup:
The old resources in US East region still need to be cleaned up using:
```bash
./cleanup-aws-east.sh
```
