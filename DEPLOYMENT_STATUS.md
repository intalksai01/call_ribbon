**S3 Bucket Created:**
- Name: `intalksai-call-ribbon-widget-844605843483`
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Status: ✅ **LIVE**
- Files Uploaded: 16 files (3.1 MB total)

**Widget Files:**
```
✅ index.html
✅ asset-manifest.json
✅ static/js/main.48447990.js (156.85 KB gzipped)
✅ static/css/main.c883816c.css (2.32 KB gzipped)
✅ static/media/* (audio files)
✅ favicon, logos, manifest
```

**Widget Access:**
- S3 Direct URL: `https://intalksai-call-ribbon-widget-844605843483.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- Note: Bucket is PRIVATE (secure configuration)
- Next: Set up CloudFront for public access OR use API server to serve widget

---

### **🔄 IN PROGRESS: API Deployment**

**Elastic Beanstalk:**
- Application: `intalksai-call-ribbon-api`
- Environment: `production`
- Instance Type: `t3.micro`
- Platform: `Node.js`
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Status: 🔄 **DEPLOYING** (5-10 minutes)

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGINS=*
```

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps (After API Deployment Completes)**

### **1. Get API URL**
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"
cd /Users/arun/cursor/call_control/exotel-call-ribbon/api
eb status production
```

Look for the "CNAME" field - that's your API URL.

### **2. Test API**
```bash
# Replace with your actual API URL
curl http://production.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T...",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### **3. Set Up Widget Access (Choose One)**

#### **Option A: CloudFront (Recommended for Production)**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ HTTPS included
- ✅ Global CDN (fast worldwide)
- ✅ Professional setup
- ✅ Free SSL certificate

**Steps:**
1. Go to AWS Console → CloudFront
2. Create Distribution
3. Origin Domain: `intalksai-call-ribbon-widget-844605843483.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
4. Origin Access: Origin Access Control (OAC)
5. Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
6. Wait 10-15 minutes for deployment
7. Get CloudFront URL: `https://d1234567890.cloudfront.net`

#### **Option B: Unified Server (Simpler)**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One URL for everything
- ✅ Simpler management
- ✅ No CloudFront setup needed

**Steps:**
```bash
# Deploy unified server instead
cd /Users/arun/cursor/call_control/exotel-call-ribbon/api
# Replace server.js with unified-server.js
cp unified-server.js server.js
eb deploy production
```

---

## 🔐 **Security Configuration**

### **Current Setup:**
- ✅ S3 bucket is PRIVATE (Block Public Access enabled)
- ✅ Widget files uploaded securely
- ✅ API uses environment variables
- ✅ CORS configured

### **Before Going Live:**
1. Update Exotel credentials in `api/server.js`
2. Generate unique API keys for clients
3. Configure allowed domains per client
4. Set up CloudFront with HTTPS
5. Enable CloudWatch monitoring

---

## 💰 **Cost Estimate**

### **Current Resources:**
```
S3 Storage (Widget):        ~$0.50/month
S3 Data Transfer:           ~$0.50/month
Elastic Beanstalk (API):    ~$10-15/month
  - t3.micro instance
  - Auto-scaling disabled
  - Single AZ

Total (Basic):              ~$11-16/month
```

### **With CloudFront:**
```
CloudFront (10GB/month):    ~$1.00/month
SSL Certificate:            FREE (AWS Certificate Manager)

Total (Production):         ~$12-17/month
```

- [ ] Get API URL from `eb status`
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://YOUR_API_URL/api/health`
- [ ] Test init endpoint with demo API key
- [ ] Update Exotel credentials
- [ ] Test with real phone number
- [ ] Set up CloudFront for widget
- [ ] Test complete flow end-to-end
